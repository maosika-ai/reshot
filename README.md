## The problem

You have a clip whose fight, dance or camera move is exactly what you want in your own AI video. There are two ways to get it, and both fail:

- **Feed the clip to the video model as a reference.** It copies the faces, the clothes and the look along with the moves. If the clip has real people in it, the platform's content check may refuse it outright.
- **Describe the moves in words.** "She kicks off the wall, grabs a pipe, throws the big guy over her shoulder" — the model gives you a different fight every time, and the camera never does what you said.

## What ReShot does

ReShot takes an `.mp4` in and writes an `.mp4` out. The output is a control video — one of three kinds:

| `--control` | what comes out | keeps | throws away | pick it for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`depth`** (default) | grey video, near = white, far = black | where everyone stands, how big they are, every move, the camera, the set's shape | faces, clothes, lighting, style | anything: fights, walks, camera moves, crowds |
| **`pose`** | OpenPose-style skeletons — coloured stick figures on black, hands included, faces not | every limb and hand, exactly | everything else, including body shape and the set | dance, martial arts, anything where the limbs are the point; the `pose` input of MiniMax H3 Fun ControlNet |
| **`canny`** | white edge lines on black | composition and outlines | colour and shading — but *not* the outline of a face or a costume | when you want the picture's layout, not only the people |

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/step1_reference.jpg" width="300" alt="reference frame"> <img src="docs/img/step2_depth.jpg" width="300" alt="the same frame as a depth map"> <img src="docs/img/step2_pose.jpg" width="300" alt="the same frame as a skeleton"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="docs/demo-pose.gif" width="720" alt="the fight scene, its skeleton, and three new takes generated from the skeleton"></p>
<p align="center"><sub>The same demo made from the <b>skeleton</b> instead of the depth map. Top: the reference and its skeleton video.

Four stills of reference · depth · skeleton: <a href="docs/img/controls_strip.jpg">controls_strip.jpg</a>.</sub></p>

You give that video to your video model as the reference and describe the people and the look in the prompt. The model takes the moves from the video and everything else from your words.

Technically: depth is monocular video depth estimation (Video Depth Anything), normalised once over the whole clip to 8-bit grey; pose is DWPose (a YOLOX person detector plus an RTMPose whole-body estimator) with identity tracking, visibility hysteresis and One-Euro smoothing across frames, drawn in the OpenPose layout the video ControlNets were trained on; canny is OpenCV, no model at all.

## How to use it

The three takes in the demo were made exactly this way. Every file involved is in this repo, so you can repeat it.

### 1. Install

**No install:** [open the notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maosika-ai/reshot/blob/main/examples/reshot_colab.ipynb) — a free GPU, upload a clip, download `depth.mp4`. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/maosika-ai/reshot/blob/main/examples/reshot_colab.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab"></a>

```bash
pip install reshot        # needs ffmpeg on PATH
```

No ffmpeg? `pip install "reshot[ffmpeg]"` bundles one. No Python set up at all? [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) does everything in one line: `uvx --from "reshot[ffmpeg]" reshot reference.mp4 -o depth.mp4 --target seedance`. The model weights (111 MB) download on first run.

**Official channels only:** ReShot by Maosika is published only on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/reshot/), GitHub [maosika-ai](https://github.com/maosika-ai/reshot), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maosika/reshot) and [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/maosika/reshot) — there is no `.exe` or Windows installer, so any "ReShot" zip or exe offered elsewhere is not ours; do not run it.

### Or let your AI coding tool do it

Using Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or any other AI agent? Paste this and it will install, verify the GPU, and run a test clip for you:

```
Install ReShot (the "reshot" package on PyPI) on this machine and get it working.
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maosika-ai/reshot/main/docs/AGENT_INSTALL.md and follow it step by step:
detect the OS and GPU, install the right PyTorch build first, then `pip install "reshot[ffmpeg]"`,
set HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com if I'm in China, run the fake-backend smoke test, then a real run
on a short clip with --metrics and show me the numbers. Don't say it's done until depth.mp4 exists.
```

### 2. Make the control video

**Easiest — the web page.** Type `reshot` with nothing after it: a page opens in your browser (everything stays on your computer). Drop the clip in, pick **what to make** (depth map / skeleton / lines) and which model it is for, click the button. You get the reference and the result side by side, the numbers, a download button, and the prompt line to paste into Seedance or MiniMax H3.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/web_ui_en.jpg" width="720" alt="the ReShot web page: reference clip and skeleton side by side; what to make, target and quality on the right"></p>

```bash
reshot                     # opens http://127.0.0.1:8765 — results land in ~/ReShot
reshot web --port 9000 --out ./depth --no-browser     # options, if you want them
```

**Or the command line**, for scripts and folders:

```bash
reshot reference.mp4 -o depth.mp4 --target seedance                  # depth map (default)
reshot reference.mp4 -o pose.mp4  --target h3 --control pose         # skeletons; pip install "reshot[pose]" first
reshot reference.mp4 -o out/      --control depth,pose,canny         # all three, out/reference_<control>.mp4
```

`--target seedance` sets 24 fps, H.264, a frame size that is a multiple of 16 and at least 407,696 pixels, up to 15 seconds — the reference-video rules of the Seedance API. For MiniMax H3 use `--target h3` (multiples of 32). On an RTX 4090 a 12-second clip takes about 20 seconds for depth; on a MacBook a few minutes for depth and about 1.5 minutes for skeletons (the pose models run on the CPU there). A whole folder at once, one model load: `reshot clips/*.mp4 -o depth/ --target seedance`.

`--control pose` also writes the skeletons as JSON with `--keypoints pose.json` (every person, every frame, 134 points with scores, a stable id per person) — so you can edit, retarget or analyse them; the web page offers the same file as a download.

### 3. Give it to the video model

**Seedance 2.0 / 2.5.** Upload `depth.mp4` as a reference video. In the prompt, point at it and describe the people and the look:

```
参考@视频1的动作与运镜，顺序与视频保持一致。
一名穿深绿色丝绒旗袍的女子在狭窄的金属走廊里与三名黑衣守卫搏斗，冷蓝走廊光，红色警示灯，电影感。
```

With a skeleton video say so, and say the lines must not appear: `参考@视频1里火柴人的动作与运镜，顺序与视频保持一致；只取动作和机位，画面里不要出现骨架线条。`

**ComfyUI.** Install [ComfyUI-ReShot](https://github.com/maosika-ai/ComfyUI-ReShot) and drop the *ReShot Depth Video* node between Load Video and your model — no command line at all.

**MiniMax H3.** Attach `depth.mp4` as `<Video 1>`. If you want a specific face, attach a character sheet as `<Picture 1>`. These are the three sheets used for the demo:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/step3_sheets.jpg" width="720" alt="the three character sheets used as Picture 1"></p>

MiniMax H3 wants its prompt in a fixed six-section format. The full prompts for all three takes are in [`docs/prompts/`](docs/prompts/). The part that does the work is how `<Video 1>` is defined and what it is allowed to transfer:

```
<Subject 3> is the fight choreography and camera movement shown in <Video 1>, a grey depth map
in which near objects are white and far objects are black: one fighter leans on a corridor wall
in close-up, kicks off it to tear down a pipe, fights several opponents, is grabbed from behind
by the largest and throws him, slams the last one into a wall panel, wipes the mouth in close-up,
then walks away through a door past the fallen opponents.

<Subject 3>: attribute_transfer - every action, position, timing and camera move of <Video 1>
is transferred onto <Subject 1> and <Subject 2>; its grey depth look is not transferred.
```

Two things in there matter. **Say in words what happens in the grey clip** — the model reads the depth map far better when the prompt tells it what the blobs are doing. **Say that the grey look is not to be copied**, or you may get a grey film back.

For a skeleton video the same two sentences become `<Video 1>, an OpenPose skeleton video — coloured stick figures on black, one per person: …` and `… the stick-figure look is not transferred.` With the Fun ControlNet weights in ComfyUI, `pose.mp4` goes straight into the ControlNet's **pose** input instead — no prompt gymnastics needed. The web page prints the right lines for whichever you made.

### 4. What comes out

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/step4_takes.jpg" width="720" alt="the three takes"></p>

Left to right: [Jiang Xue](docs/prompts/take1_jiangxue_armor.txt) in bronze armour, [Su Wan](docs/prompts/take2_suwan_qipao.txt) in a green velvet qipao, and a [rabbit boxer](docs/prompts/take3_rabbit_boxer.txt) against a wolf, a tiger and a bear as a 3D animated feature. Same six shots, same close-up at the start, same walk out through the door at the end. The reference clip itself was a Seedance 2.0 text-to-video render (864×496, 12 s) and the takes were made on MiniMax H3, so nobody's likeness was involved at any step.

## What transfers, and what doesn't

**Transfers:** who stands where, how big they are relative to each other, every move and its timing, the cuts, and the camera — push-ins, tracking, handheld shake.

**Doesn't:** faces (use a character sheet), clothes, lighting, colour, props in detail, and anything smaller than a hand. Those come from your prompt and your reference images.

**Depth or pose?** Depth carries the whole picture — where the walls are, who is bigger, a pipe being torn off — and works on anything, people or not. Pose carries only the people, but every limb and finger exactly, and nothing of their body shape or the set. Use pose for dance and martial arts, depth for everything else; when in doubt make both (`--control depth,pose`) and see which one the model follows better. We re-made the three demo takes on MiniMax H3 with the skeleton as `<Video 1>` (same prompts, same sheets): all three reproduce the six beats like the depth takes, and the throw reads more clearly from the skeleton — see the second GIF above. One take per condition with different seeds, so read it as "pose works as a reference video too", not "pose is better".

We tested that on MiniMax H3 with the three demo takes: same prompts, same character sheets, only `<Video 1>` swapped from the depth map to the skeleton video (and the two sentences that describe it). All three skeleton takes reproduce the six beats — close-up, brawl, the throw, the panel, the walk out past the fallen guards — at the same level as the depth takes; the throw reads more clearly from the skeleton. One take per condition, different seeds, so read it as "pose works as a reference video too", not as "pose is better". The prompts with seeds are in [`docs/prompts/`](docs/prompts/) (`*_pose.txt`).

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/pose_vs_depth_takes.jpg" width="864" alt="reference row, then depth take and skeleton take for each of the three characters, six shots each"></p>
<p align="center"><sub>Top: the reference. Then, per character, the take made from the depth map and the take made from the skeleton — six shots each.</sub></p> One case where pose is the wrong tool: a tight close-up. The estimator still guesses where the shoulders and hips are when they are off screen, and draws them along the frame edge — depth carries a close-up faithfully. Canny carries the outline of clothes and faces too, so "copy the shot, not the actors" is only half true for it.

Things we learned making the demo:

- **Keep the reference under 15 seconds** (Seedance's limit) and cut it to the shots you want before running ReShot. Everything in the clip gets copied, including the boring part at the end.
- **For MiniMax H3, make the depth map small: `--target h3 --max-res 320`** (that is 320×176 for a 16:9 clip). A full-size grey silhouette starts to pull the character's face shape towards the person in the reference; a small one carries the moves without the shape.
- **Change the species, keep the size ratio.** The bear take works because the prompt says the bear is "about 1.3× the rabbit, never more than 1.5×". The depth map already says who is bigger; the prompt must not contradict it.
- **Plain clothes on extras, no logos.** Whatever the prompt leaves open, the model fills with text and badges.

## What you need

| | Runs? | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| **NVIDIA, 8 GB or more** (RTX 3070, 4060, 4090 …) | Yes | default `--quality fast`: 3 GB VRAM, 34 ms/frame on a 3080 Ti |
| **NVIDIA, 12 GB or more** | Yes, and `--quality full` fits too | full: 11 GB VRAM, 83 ms/frame on a 3080 Ti, 62 ms/frame on a 4090 |
| **Apple Silicon** | Yes | default `fast`: M2 Max 46 ms/frame, a 12 s clip in about 18 s |
| **CPU only** | Yes, slow | ~1.8 s/frame |
| **Host RAM** | 16 GB covers clips up to ~27 s at 720p | peak = 2 GB + 224 MB per second of 720p; the tool refuses before starting if a clip won't fit |
| **`--control pose`** | any of the above; needs `pip install "reshot[pose]"` (ONNX Runtime; `onnxruntime-gpu` for CUDA) | M2 Max on the CPU: 306 ms/frame, a 12 s clip in 90 s; two weight files, 340 MB, once. Host RAM ≈ 1.4 GB |
| **`--control canny`** | anything | no model; the 12 s clip in under a second |

**`--quality` — the resolution the model works at.** The output video is always the size of your source; this sets the size of the picture the depth model looks at.

| `--quality` | model sees (16:9 · 9:16 · 4:3) | VRAM | speed | detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fast` (default) | 644×364 · 364×644 · 490×364 | ~3 GB | 34 ms/frame on a 3080 Ti | large shapes identical to full; a loose strand of hair merges into the cheek |
| `full` | 924×518 · 518×924 · 686×518 | ~11 GB | 83 ms/frame on a 3080 Ti | sharper fine silhouettes |

The web page has the same two choices under **Quality**; the command line takes `--quality`. Quality applies to depth only — the pose models have fixed working sizes (640 px for the detector, 288×384 per person for the estimator) and canny is per pixel at the output size.

**Pose speed knob — `--pose-detect-every N` (default 3).** The person detector is 80 % of the pose cost on a CPU, so it runs on every third frame and the skeletons of the previous frame supply the boxes in between; a cut in the clip or a skeleton that has gone unreliable brings the detector back at once. Measured on the 289-frame corridor clip against detecting every frame: 280 of 289 frames have the same people, 80 % of joints land within 2 px and 91 % within 5 px; the 9 differing frames are a person entering the shot and getting their skeleton one or two frames late. It is 35 % faster (306 vs 469 ms/frame on an M2 Max). `--pose-detect-every 1` turns it off.

We recommend `fast`: for copying blocking and camera it is all a video model needs — the demo takes were made from a depth map shrunk to 320×176 before it even reached MiniMax H3, far below either setting. Measured full against fast on the same 294-frame clip: mean difference 5.3 of 255 grey levels, 95 % of pixels within 15, edge energy −4.5 %. Use `full` for close-ups where thin silhouettes matter and you have the VRAM. The run prints the exact resolution it uses (`model  fast: the model sees 644x364`) and records it in `--metrics`. Experts can set any short side with `--input-size`.

Verified on rented cards on 2026-09-12; the numbers are in the `--metrics` output of those runs.

## Presets

| `--target` | fps | frame size | length | for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `seedance` | 24 | ×16, ≥ 407,696 px | ≤ 15 s | Seedance 2.0 / 2.5 reference video |
| `h3` | 24 | ×32 | ≤ 15 s | MiniMax H3 (reference video or Fun ControlNet depth) |
| `wan` | 16 | ×16 | – | Wan 2.1 VACE |
| `none` | source | even | – | anything that reads a depth video |

`reshot --help` lists every option; the [user guide](docs/USAGE.md) explains them.

## For developers

```python
from pathlib import Path
from reshot import RunConfig, run

run(RunConfig(input=Path("reference.mp4"), output=Path("depth.mp4"), target="seedance"))
```

Four details make the output something a video model will actually follow:

- **One scale for the whole clip.** Depth is normalised once over all frames, never per frame, so a wall keeps the same grey when someone walks past it. Per-frame normalisation makes the scene "breathe".
- **Skeletons that don't flicker.** A per-frame pose estimator swaps people, jitters joints and blinks limbs at the visibility threshold; a video model reads all three as motion. ReShot tracks each person across frames (IoU of body boxes), holds a joint until its score drops well below the draw threshold (hysteresis), and runs a One-Euro filter per joint — still at rest, quick to follow a punch.
- **Frames picked by timestamp.** 30 fps → 24 fps really is 24; nothing is duplicated or dropped in a pattern the model could learn.
- **Cropped, never padded.** Frame size is trimmed to the model's grid. A black border would read as a far wall.

Pose from Python:

```python
from reshot import RunConfig, run
run(RunConfig(input=Path("reference.mp4"), output=Path("pose.mp4"), target="h3", control="pose", keypoints=Path("pose.json")))

from reshot.backends import get_backend
from reshot.pose.tracking import stabilise
from reshot.pose.skeleton import render_frame
clip = get_backend("dwpose").infer(frames, fps)   # frames: uint8 RGB [T, H, W, 3] → PoseClip
stabilise(clip)                                    # track → hysteresis → smooth, in place
rgb = render_frame(clip.keypoints[0], clip.scores[0], h, w, hands=True, face=False)
```

The model is Video Depth Anything Small (ByteDance, CVPR 2025). It works on overlapping 32-frame windows and aligns them, so depth doesn't jitter between frames. A 12-second 720p clip peaks at 3.9 GB of host RAM and 11 GB of VRAM (3 GB with `--input-size 364`) (measured; the estimate the tool shows before starting is a fitted line, within 0.05 GB of measurements) and it refuses up front if a clip won't fit. A `fake` backend runs the whole pipeline without a model for your own tests. Errors that are yours to fix are `ReshotError` subclasses with an exit code and a concrete fix in the message.
